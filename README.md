# A Cluster Analysis Of Composite Indicators In Technology Readiness Across Countries

Author: [Camilo Vargas](https://www.github.com/cvas91)

**Abstract:** 
- Technology readiness measures the capacity of a country to adapt and implement new technological developments based on its current capacity and resources. 
- Several organizations have developed composite indicators to rank countriesâ€™ technological performance. However, these methods imply a linear, equal comparison across all countries, which may not be a reliable tool for policymakers worldwide with different necessities and economic conditions. 
- Therefore, this project diverts from this standard simple version by implementing data mining techniques like Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA) by clustering countries with similar technical and economic conditions. 
- The statistical findings from the PCA method suggest that countries share similar components regardless of their inner conditions. However, FA suggests that technology factors vary across clusters; this means that countries could be diverse as it is expected to observe distinct composite indicators among clusters. 
- For further analysis and discussion, the full printed version of this project is available upon request.

### Motivation
- The last technological revolution has left many lingering concerns among policymakers and scholars about a country's technological capacity. 
- More specifically, if the effects of globalization could evolve in developing countries, or whether elite developed nations will continue to be the front-runners of technological advances and innovation. 
- This project will discuss the significant need to quantify and measure technology readiness at the country level through the aggregation of different technical dimensions.
